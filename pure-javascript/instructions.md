node postgresql

Using JS and NodeExpress (https://expressjs.com/) build a server that has at least 4 working endpoints that all do different things (at least one endpoint should take in input from the client) AND the server will dish at least 2 different html pages.

By endpoint, have functions like adding new object, removing object, updating, etc.

No need for database, so make a javascript object that tolls a list during runtime so you can add to it (hardcode list but still be able to build on it during runtime)
