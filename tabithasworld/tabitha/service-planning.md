Let's work on the webpage design first and see what I need as I go along

Login:
SERVICE:
- validate login credentials. the username and password must be a match in the database

E2E:
- if you enter incorrect username or password, an error will appear. system will not let you into homepage you will stay on login page
- if you enter correct username AND password, you will be taken to your home page
- if you want to register for a new account, you can click on the registration page link and it'll take you to the registration page

Registration:
SERVICE:
- validate all fields are present (first name, username, password, email, zip code)
- limit first name to 25 characters
- limit username to 50 characters
- limit password to 50 characters
- password must have !@#$%^&* in it
- email must be in email format
- zip code must be 5 characters and all numbers

these are all needed to make a proper user object

E2E:
- all fields must be validly filled out to register
- if user hovers over each field, a text will appear explaining why that information is needed 
- check each field if it were not filled out if they can register
- check each field if it were not filled out validly if they can register
- if not valid, make sure an error pops up letting them know why they can't register
